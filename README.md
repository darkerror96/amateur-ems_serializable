UseCase: - An Employee Management System is designed to simplify the process of record maintenance of employees in an organisation. It helps in managing the information of employees for HR functions. In general, EMS is a part of a comprehensive Human Resource Management System. Most modern companies use computers to collect this information, making their system more accurate and problem-free. A database is often used to collect the information required.

Employee Management System as a Java Application using Spring Tool Suite 4 as an IDE.

Simple Java Application to understand Basic OOP concepts viz Inheritance, Polymorphism, Serializable, etc.

For all beginners, this is perfect repository to start-off with a java application describing Employee Management System in simple manner. I have used Serializable concept for data persistence. I have used Spring Tool Suite 4 as an IDE.

For testing the application, you have to run the application on console/terminal. On the console/terminal, you will be asked to select choices to manage the Employees and Managers. I have added basic functionalities for managing the Employee viz. Create, Search, Update, Delete, Print Employee, Print Manager's Team, Save the current state, etc.

NOTE: - Files are already initialized with unreal Employees and Managers Details.
